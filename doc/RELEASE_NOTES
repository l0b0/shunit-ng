Release Notes for shUnit2 2.1.0
===============================

This release was branched from shUnit2 2.0.1. It mostly adds new functionality,
but there are couple of bugs fixed from the previous release.

See the ``CHANGES-2.1.rst`` file for a full list of changes.


Tested Platforms
----------------

This list of platforms comes from the latest version of log4sh as shUnit2 is
used in the testing of log4sh on each of these platforms.

Cygwin

- bash 3.2.9(10)
- pdksh 5.2.14

Linux

- bash 3.1.17(1), 3.2.10(1)
- dash 0.5.3
- ksh 1993-12-28
- pdksh 5.2.14
- zsh 4.3.2 (does not work)

Mac OS X 10.4.8 (Darwin 8.8)

- bash 2.05b.0(1)
- ksh 1993-12-28

Solaris 8 U3 (x86)

- /bin/sh
- bash 2.03.0(1)
- ksh M-11/16/88i

Solaris 10 U2 (sparc)

- /bin/sh
- bash 3.00.16(1)
- ksh M-11/16/88i

Solaris 10 U2 (x86)

- /bin/sh
- bash 3.00.16(1)
- ksh M-11/16/88i


New Features
------------

Test skipping

  Support added for test "skipping". A skip mode can be enabled so that
  subsequent ``assert`` and ``fail`` functions that are called will be recorded
  as "skipped" rather than as "passed" or "failed". This functionality can be
  used such that when a set of tests makes sense on one platform but not on
  another, they can be effectively disabled without altering the total number
  of tests.

  One example might be when something is supported under ``bash``, but not
  under a standard Bourne shell.

  New functions: ``startSkipping()``, ``endSkipping``, ``isSkipping``


Changes and Enhancements
------------------------

Moving to the use of `reStructured Text
<http://docutils.sourceforge.net/rst.html>`_ for documentation. It is easy to
read and edit in textual form, but converts nicely to HTML.

The report format has changed. Rather than including a simple "success"
percentage at the end, a percentage is given for each type of test.


Bug Fixes
---------

The ``fail()`` function did not output the optional failure message.

Fixed the ``Makefile`` so that the DocBook XML and XSLT files would be
downloaded before documentation parsing will continue.


Deprecated Features
-------------------

None.


Known Bugs and Issues
---------------------

None.

Release Notes for shUnit2 2.1.1
===============================

This is mainly a bug fix release, but it also incorporates a realignment with
the JUnit 4 code. Asserts now provide better failure messages, and the failure
functions no longer perform tests.

See the ``CHANGES-2.1.txt`` file for a full list of changes.

Changes and Enhancements
------------------------

for a conditional test. A value of '0' is considered 'true', while any non-zero
value is considered 'false'.

Self-testing unit tests were added.


Bug Fixes
---------

The ``fail()`` assert now honors skipping.

The ``docs-docbook-prep`` target now works properly.

All asserts now properly unset their variables.


Deprecated Features

Release Notes for shUnit2 2.1.2
===============================

This release adds initial support for the zsh shell. Due to some differences
with this shell as compared with others, some special checks have been added,
and there are some extra requirements necessary when this shell is to be used.

To use zsh with shUnit2, the following two requirements must be met:
* The ``shwordsplit`` option must be set.
* The ``function_argzero`` option must be unset.

Please read the Shell Errata section of the documentation for guidance on how
to meet these requirements.


See the ``CHANGES-2.1.txt`` file for a full list of changes.

ksh and pdksh do not pass null arguments (i.e. empty strings as '') properly,
and as such checks do not work properly.

zsh requires the ``shwordsplit`` option to be set, and the ``function_argzero``
option to be unset for proper operation.

Release Notes for shUnit2 2.1.3
===============================

This release is minor feature release. It improves support for zsh (although it
still isn't what it could be) and adds automated testing framework support by
returning a non-zero exit when tests fail.

To use zsh with shUnit2, the following two requirements must be met:
* The ``shwordsplit`` option must be set.
* The ``function_argzero`` option must be unset.

Please read the Shell Errata section of the documentation for guidance on how

New Features
------------

Support added for output assert source line number as part of assert messages.

Issue #2: Added assertNotEquals() assert.

Provided a public ``shunit_tmpDir`` variable that can be used by unit test
scripts that need automated and guaranteed cleanup.


Changes and Enhancements
------------------------

Issue #3: Removed the check for unset variables as shUnit2 should not expect
scripts being tested to be clean.

Issue #4: Rewrote the test summary. It is now greatly simplified and much more
script friendly.

Issue #5: Fixed the documentation around the usage of failures.

Issue #9: Added unit tests and improved documentation around the use of macros.

Code updated to meet documented coding standards.

Improved code reuse of ``_shunit_exit()`` and ``_shunit_fatal()`` functions.

All output except shUnit2 error messages now goes to STDOUT.

Converted DocBook documentation to reStructuredText for easier maintenance.


Bug Fixes
---------

Issue #1: Fixed bug in rap code where certain types of exit conditions did not
generate the ending report.

Issue #7: Fixed duplicated printing of messages passed to asserts.

Fixed bugs in ``shlib_relToAbsPath()`` in ``shlib``.


Deprecated Features
-------------------

None.


Known Bugs and Issues
---------------------

Zsh requires the ``shwordsplit`` option to be set. See the documentation for
examples of how to do this.

Line numbers in assert messages do not work properly with BASH 2.x.

The Bourne shell of Solaris, BASH 2.x, and Zsh 3.0.x do not properly catch the
SIGTERM signal. As such, shell interpreter failures due to such things as
unbound variables cannot be caught. (See ``shunit_test_misc.sh``)

Release Notes for shUnit2 2.1.6
===============================

This release contains some bug fixes and changes. It is also the first release
to support running shunit2 as a standalone program.

Please read the Shell Errata section of the documentation for guidance on how
to meet these requirements.

See the ``CHANGES-2.1.txt`` file for a full list of changes.

New Features
------------

Support for running shUnit2 as a standalone program. This makes it possible for
users to execute their unit tests in a manner that is not dependent on the
location an OS distribution maintainer chose to place shUnit2 in the file
system.

Changes and Enhancements
------------------------

Renamed the public ``shunit_tmpDir`` variable to ``SHUNIT_TMPDIR`` to be more
consistent with the ``TMPDIR`` variable.

Bug Fixes
---------

Fixed issue where shunit2 would fail on some distributions when creating a
temporary directory because the **od** command was not present.

Deprecated Features
-------------------

None.


Known Bugs and Issues
---------------------

Zsh requires the ``shwordsplit`` option to be set. See the documentation for
examples of how to do this.

Line numbers in assert messages do not work properly with BASH 2.x.

The Bourne shell of Solaris, BASH 2.x, and Zsh 3.0.x do not properly catch the
SIGTERM signal. As such, shell interpreter failures due to such things as
unbound variables cannot be caught. (See ``shunit_test_misc.sh``)
